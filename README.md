## 📌 Project Overview

- **Tool Used:** Microsoft Power BI
- **File Type:** `.pbix`
- **Purpose:** To practice and showcase data analysis and visualization skills.
- **Use Case:** [Replace this line with your case, e.g. “Sales performance analysis”, “Student performance analysis”, “E-commerce orders analysis”, etc.]

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Clean and organize raw data for analysis.
2. Build meaningful charts and visuals for quick insights.
3. Create an easy-to-understand dashboard for non-technical users.
4. Practice measures, relationships, and DAX (if used).

## 📊 Visuals & Charts Used

The report includes Power BI visuals such as:

- **Bar/Column Charts:** For comparing values across categories (e.g., sales by product, marks by subject).
- **Line Chart:** For showing trends over time (e.g., monthly sales, performance over semesters).
- **Card Visuals:** For showing key metrics like Total Sales, Total Orders, Average Score, etc.
- **Pie/Donut Chart (if used):** For showing percentage share of categories.
- **Slicers/Filters:** To interact with the data (e.g., filter by date, category, region, etc.).

[You can edit this list according to your exact report.]
